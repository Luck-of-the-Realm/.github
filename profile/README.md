## What Is Coming -- Downtime Activities

As a DM and also a player, I wanted to bring something to the table that users can play BETWEEN sessions. If you are anything like me, you spend your days between sessions looking forward to getting into trouble on your next adventures. This application is going to bridge the gap between Sessions, allowing players to utilize Downtime during the week (at the DM's discretion) to build up resources, materials, relationships, quests, you name it! <br><br>

Here is what is planned, with many more ideas being added as I go!

## About Me

My name is Hunter, and I am an avid table-top, roleplay, campaigner! My character is Thumper Rumper, a 2ft tall Harengon rogue who lives by the motto, "I may be cute on the outside..." <br><br>
In reality, he is the "Robin Hood" of little bunny rogues, looking out for the poor, and stealing from the wealthy whenever he can.
