## About Me

My name is Hunter, and I am an avid table-top, roleplay, campaigner! My character is Thumper Rumper, a 2ft tall Harengon rogue who lives by the motto, "I may be cute on the outside..." <br>
In reality, he is the "Robin Hood" of little bunny rogues, looking out for the poor, and stealing from the wealthy whenever he can.
